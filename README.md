## 🚀 Overview
Hi, I’m Nadine! 👋 🇿🇦

I am an aspiring Full Stack AI Engineer (self-taught) focused on bridging the gap between local logic and cloud-based AI solutions.

This repository serves as a centralized log for my journey into **Full Stack AI Engineering**. 

It also serves as a living library of all my technical growth, from foundational Python scripts to complex AI integrations.
